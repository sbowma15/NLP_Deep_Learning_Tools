I. NLP Deep Learning Examples: Text Generation

This notebook provides examples of Natural Language Processing (NLP) deep learning using GPT-2 through the Hugging Face transformers module/library. It covers the following steps:

Importing and downloading necessary modules, models, and classes.
Installing the transformers module.
Setting up a starting text sequence.
Generating text sequences using GPT-2.
How to Run:
Make sure to have a good internet connection as downloading the language model may require ~500MB.
If using an online platform like Google Colab, consider the storage space.
Follow the provided code blocks to install and set up the environment.
Experiment with generating text sequences by modifying the starting text sequence.
